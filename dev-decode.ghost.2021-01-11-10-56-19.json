Python Web Scraping\\n\\n## 1. What is Web Scraping ?\\nWeb scraping is the technique for extracting the relevant information from a webpage. web scraping allows user to get the relevant information from any websites and it can be done manually as well as with the help of bots as well.\\n\\n## 2. Why Python for Web Scraping ?\\nPython has become one of the widely used programming language and with its easy to learn syntax and huge number of libraries such as BeautifulSoup, Scrapy , Pandas etc, it is one of the most preferred programming language for web scraping.\\n\\n## 3. Things to know before getting started with Web Scraping\\nWhen starting web scraping keep these poits in mind :<br>\\n1 - Web Scraping might be against the terms of service of some websites so it is suggested that first contact the administrator before starting webscraping.\\n\\n2 - Main step to start web scraping is to observe the webpage amd inspect the source code of the website thoroughly.\\n\\n3 - You should have some basic knowledge of HTML and CSS before starting web scraping because you will mostly deal with HTML and CSS code so this step is mandatory.\\n\\n<br>\\n\\n# Getting Started\\n\\n## Libraries Required\\n\\n## 1. Requests\\nit is the library which is used to make HTTP requests from python program \\n\\n\\n### Installation\\n\\nPython 3 ```pip3 install requests``` \\\\\\nPython 2.x ```pip install bs4```\\n## Methods for requests mode \\n### get()\\nget function sends the get requests to the given url which then returns a response object<br>\\n### Example\\n``` python\\nimport requests\\nsource = requests.get(url)\\n```\\n```python\\nsource.status_code\\n```\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n```python\\n200\\n```\\n\\n<br>\\n\\n\\n## 2. Beautifulsoup\\nBeautifulSoup is a python library used for parsing the HTML and XML data. We can iterated through all the data.\\n<br>You can read complete beautifulsoup documentation [here](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)\\n\\nPython 3 - ```pip3 install requests``` \\\\\\nPython 2.x - ```pip install bs4```\\n\\n### Using BeautifulSoup Library\\n### Example\\n``` python\\nimport requests\\nimport bs4\\nsource = requests.get(url)\\nsoup = bs4.BeautifulSoup(source.text,lxml)\\n```\\n## select ()\\n\\nselect() returns the list type object with the tag<br>\\n\\n| Command | Description |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| select('tag') | tag is the name of any HTML tag |\\n| select('.class_name') | class name of the tag will always start with . |\\n| select('#id') | name of id of the tag will always start with # |\\n| select('tag1 tag2') | tag1 is the main tag while tag2 is the tag which is<br>enclosed within the main tag |\\n| select('tag1 > tag2') | tag1 is the main tag while tag2 is the directly<br> enclosed within the main tag |\\n\\n<br>\\n\\n1 - Using select() to grab the title of the webpage\\n```python\\ntitle = soup.select('title')\\n```\\n\\n2 - Using select() to grab the data from a specific tag\\n```python\\ntag = soup.select(\\\"div\\\")\\n```\\n3 - Using Select() to get the data from an attribute of a tag\\n```python\\ntag = soup.select(\\\"img\\\")\\ntag[\\\"src\\\"]\\n```\\n4- Using select() to get data from the tag with specific id\\n``` python\\n# id will always start with #\\nid_data = soup.select(\\\"#id\\\")\\n```\\n\\n5- Using select() to get data from the tag with specific class\\n``` python\\n# class will always start with .\\nid_data = soup.select(\\\".class\\\")\\n```\"}]],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[10,0],[10,1],[1,\"p\",[]]]}","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2021/01/Untitled.svg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h1 id=\"pythonwebscraping\">Python Web Scraping</h1>\n<h2 id=\"1whatiswebscraping\">1.

Collections are containers that are used to store collections of data.\\n#### There are 4 Built-in collections or data structure namely:-\\n- List\\n- Dictionary\\n- Tuple\\n- Set\\n\\n## What is a List?\\n\\nA List is used to store the sequence of various types of data. Data are inclosed inside [ ] brackets seprated by commas(,). Lists are mutable in nature it means data which can be changed when required. Duplicate entries are allowed in list.  A list can also have another list as an item. This is called a nested list.\\n\\n###### Syntax:-\\n    list1 = [ ] #Empty List\\n    list2 = [ sequence1 ]\\n    list3 = [ sequence1, sequence2, sequence3 ]\\n    \\n###### Example:-\\n    language = ['C','C++','Java','Python']       //List of Strings\\n    number = [3,5,4,9]                           //List of Numbers\\n    mixed = ['Mango','Apple',1,'Banana',8]       //List of Mixed Data Type \\n    nested = [['Raman', 'Nikhil'],[2,5,7]]       //List of Nested List\\n    deep_nested = ['Honey','Deepak',[1,5,8,['Akshay','Shubham',['India','Australia]]]]              //Deeply Nested\\n    \\n- Each element in the list has a position in the list known as an index.

If the values in the collection are meant to remain constant for the life of the program, using a tuple instead of a list guards against accidental modification.\\n\\n- There is another Python data type that you will encounter shortly called a dictionary, which requires as one of its components a value that is of an immutable type.

A class is like a blueprint while an instance is a copy of the class with actual values.\\n * An object consists of :\\n \\n         1. State : It is represented by attributes of an object. It also reflects the properties of an object.\\n         2. Behavior : It is represented by methods of an object. It also reflects the response of an object with other objects.\\n         3. Identity : It gives a unique name to an object and enables one object to interact with other objects\\n         \\n###### Create Object ( Example 1 )\\n      Now we can use the class named car to create objects:\\n   \\n      class car:\\n          x = 5\\n\\n     p1 = car()\\n     print(p1.x)\\n###### output:\\n     5\\n     Maruti\\n\\n     \\n###### Example 2     \\n    class Jeep:  \\n      \\n               # A simple class \\n               # attribute \\n          company = \\\"Maruti\\\"\\n          location = \\\"India\\\"\\n  \\n              # A sample method   \\n          def test(self):  \\n               print(\\\"I'm from\\\", self.company) \\n               print(\\\"I'm made in \\\", self.location) \\n  \\n\\n    # Object instantiation \\n    jimny = Jeep() \\n  \\n    # Accessing class attributes \\n    # and method through objects \\n    print(jimny.company) \\n    jimny.test() \\n\\n###### output:\\n    Maruti\\n    I'm from Maruti\\n    I'm made in  India\\n    \\nIn the above example, an object is created which is basically a ***Jeep*** named ***jimny***. This class only has two class attributes that tell us that ***jimny*** is from ***Maruti*** and made from ***India***.<br>\\n**NOTE**: The  ***self***  parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belong to the class.\\n\\n\\n***The self Parameter***\\n - Class methods must have an extra first parameter in method definition. We do not give a value for this parameter when we call the method, Python provides it.\\n - If we have a method which takes no arguments, then we still have to have one argument.\\n - This is similar to this pointer in C++ and this reference in Java.\\n - The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belongs to the class.\\n - It does not have to be named self , you can call it whatever you like, but it has to be the first parameter of any function in the class:\\n ##### Example:\\n    class Car:\\n        def __init__(sampleobject, name, price):\\n            sampleobject.name = name\\n            sampleobject.age = price\\n\\n       def myfunc(abc):\\n           print(\\\"Hello ,  my car is \\\" + abc.name)\\n\\n    p1 = Car(\\\"BMW\\\", 1)\\n    p1.myfunc()\\n###### output:\\n    Hello ,  my car is BMW\\n    \\n    \\n **The __init__() Function**\\n  - The __init__ method is similar to constructors in C++ and Java.\\n  - Constructors are used to initialize the object. Like methods, a constructor also contains a collection of statements(i.e. instructions) that are executed at the time of Object creation. \\n  - It is run as soon as an object of a class is instantiated. The method is useful to do any initialization you want to do with your object.\\n  - All classes have a function called __init__(), which is always executed when the class is being initiated.\\n  - Use the __init__() function to assign values to object properties, or other operations that are necessary to do when the object is being created:\\n\\n\\n###### Example:\\n         class Car:\\n                def __init__(self, company):\\n                         self.company =  company \\n                         \\n\\n          p1 = Car(\\\"Maruti\\\" )\\n\\n          print(p1.company)\\n####### output:\\n              Maruti\\n**Modify Object Properties**\\n - You can modify properties on objects like this:\\n ###### Example:\\n        class Car:\\n              def __init__(self, model, rate):\\n                           self.model = model\\n                           self.rate = rate\\n\\n              def  myfunc(self):\\n                           print(\\\"Hello my name is \\\" + self.model)\\n\\n         p1 = Car(\\\"Swift\\\", 500000)\\n         p1.myfunc()\\n         print(p1.model)\\n         print(\\\"Previous rate of my model was \\\" , p1.rate) \\n         p1.rate = 400000\\n         print(\\\"New rate is\\\" , p1.rate)\\n\\n###### output:\\n          Hello my name is Swift\\n          Swift\\n          Previous rate of my model was  500000\\n          New rate is 400000\\n        \\n        \\n **Delete Object Properties**\\n  - You can delete properties on objects by using the del keyword:\\n\\n###### Example:\\n    class Car:\\n            def __init__(self, model, rate):\\n                   self.model = model\\n                   self.rate = rate\\n\\n            def myfunc(self):\\n                    print(\\\"Hello my name is \\\" + self.model)\\n\\n     p1 = Car(\\\"Swift\\\",500000 )\\n\\n\\n     del p1.rate\\n     print(p1.rate)\\n###### output:\\n      AttributeError: 'Car' object has no attribute 'rate'\\n**Delete Objects**\\n - You can delete objects by using the del keyword:\\n ###### Example :\\n    class Car:\\n            def __init__(self, model, rate):\\n                   self.model = model\\n                   self.rate = rate\\n\\n            def myfunc(self):\\n                    print(\\\"Hello my name is \\\" + self.model)\\n\\n    p1 = Car(\\\"Swift\\\",500000 )\\n\\n\\n    del p1\\n    print(p1.rate)\\n##### Outpput :\\n    NameError: name 'p1' is not defined\\n***The pass Statement***\\n - ***class*** definitions cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have a class definition with no content, put in the pass statement to avoid getting an error.\\n##### Example :\\n     class Person:\\n     pass\\n     # having an empty class definition like this, would raise an error without the pass statement\\n\\n##### Complete Example\\n    class Car:  \\n    \\n              # Class Variable  \\n              fav_car = 'Verna'             \\n    \\n              # The init method or constructor  \\n              def __init__(self, model, color):  \\n      \\n               # Instance Variable      \\n               self.model = model \\n               self.color = color         \\n     \\n    # Objects of Dog class  \\n    Moderna = Car(\\\"swift\\\", \\\"brown\\\")  \\n    Buziga = Car(\\\"wagonR\\\", \\\"black\\\")  \\n  \\n    print('Moderna details:')    \\n    print('Moderna is a', Moderna.fav_car)  \\n    print('Model: ', Moderna.model) \\n    print('Color: ', Moderna.color) \\n  \\n    print('\\\\nBuziga details:')    \\n    print('Buziga is a', Buziga.fav_car)  \\n    print('Model: ', Buziga.model) \\n    print('Color: ', Buziga.color) \\n  \\n    # Class variables can be accessed using class  \\n    # name also  \\n    print(\\\"\\\\nAccessing class variable using class name\\\") \\n    print(Car.fav_car)\\n##### output : \\n    Moderna is a Verna\\n    Model:  swift\\n    Color:  brown\\n\\n    Buziga details:\\n    Buziga is a Verna\\n    Model:  wagonR\\n    Color:  black\\n\\n    Accessing class variable using class name \\n    Verna\\n\"}]],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[10,0],[10,1],[1,\"p\",[]]]}","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2021/01/python.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt srcset=\"/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/python.png 600w, /content/images/2021/01/python.png 800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>\n<li>Python is an object oriented programming language.</li>\n<li>A class is a user-defined prototype from which objects are created.</li>\n<li>Classes provide a means of  functionality together.</li>\n<li>Creating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new instances of that type to be made.</li>\n<li>Each class instance can have  its own attributes.</li>\n<li>Class instances can also have methods (defined by its class) for modifying its state.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"pointstorememberonclassesinpython\">POINTS TO REMEMBER ON CLASSES IN PYTHON:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Classes are created by keyword class.</li>\n<li>Attributes are the variables that belong to class.</li>\n<li>Attributes are always public and can be accessed using dot (.) operator.</li>\n</ul>\n<h6 id=\"createaclass\">Create a <strong>Class</strong></h6>\n<pre><code>To create a class, use the keyword class:\n   \n class car:\n  x = 5\n print(car)\n</code></pre>\n<h6 id=\"output\">output:</h6>\n<pre><code>&lt;class '__main__.car'&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"classobjects\">Class Objects</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>An Object is an instance of a Class.

We do\n   not give a value for this parameter when we call the method, Python provides\n   it.\n * If we have a method which takes no arguments, then we still have to have one\n   argument.\n * This is similar to this pointer in C++ and this reference in Java.\n * The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and\n   is used to access variables that belongs to the class.\n * It does not have to be named self , you can call it whatever you like, but it\n   has to be the first parameter of any function in the class:\n\nExample:\nclass Car:\n    def __init__(sampleobject, name, price):\n        sampleobject.name = name\n        sampleobject.age = price\n\n   def myfunc(abc):\n       print(\"Hello ,  my car is \" + abc.name)\n\np1 = Car(\"BMW\", 1)\np1.myfunc()\n\n\noutput:\nHello ,  my car is BMW\n\n\nThe init() Function\n\n * The init method is similar to constructors in C++ and Java.\n * Constructors are used to initialize the object. Like methods, a constructor\n   also contains a collection of statements(i.e. instructions) that are executed\n   at the time of Object creation.\n * It is run as soon as an object of a class is instantiated. The method is\n   useful to do any initialization you want to do with your object.\n * All classes have a function called init(), which is always executed when the\n   class is being initiated.\n * Use the init() function to assign values to object properties, or other\n   operations that are necessary to do when the object is being created:\n\nExample:\n     class Car:\n            def __init__(self, company):\n                     self.company =  company \n                     \n\n      p1 = Car(\"Maruti\" )\n\n      print(p1.company)\n\n\n####### output:\nMaruti\nModify Object Properties\n\n * You can modify properties on objects like this:\n\nExample:\n    class Car:\n          def __init__(self, model, rate):\n                       self.model = model\n                       self.rate = rate\n\n          def  myfunc(self):\n                       print(\"Hello my name is \" + self.model)\n\n     p1 = Car(\"Swift\", 500000)\n     p1.myfunc()\n     print(p1.model)\n     print(\"Previous rate of my model was \" , p1.rate) \n     p1.rate = 400000\n     print(\"New rate is\" , p1.rate)\n\n\noutput:\n      Hello my name is Swift\n      Swift\n      Previous rate of my model was  500000\n      New rate is 400000\n\n\nDelete Object Properties\n\n * You can delete properties on objects by using the del keyword:\n\nExample:\nclass Car:\n        def __init__(self, model, rate):\n               self.model = model\n               self.rate = rate\n\n        def myfunc(self):\n                print(\"Hello my name is \" + self.model)\n\n p1 = Car(\"Swift\",500000 )\n\n\n del p1.rate\n print(p1.rate)\n\n\noutput:\n  AttributeError: 'Car' object has no attribute 'rate'\n\n\nDelete Objects\n\n * You can delete objects by using the del keyword:\n\nExample :\nclass Car:\n        def __init__(self, model, rate):\n               self.model = model\n               self.rate = rate\n\n        def myfunc(self):\n                print(\"Hello my name is \" + self.model)\n\np1 = Car(\"Swift\",500000 )\n\n\ndel p1\nprint(p1.rate)\n\n\nOutpput :\nNameError: name 'p1' is not defined\n\n\nThe pass Statement\n\n * class definitions cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have a class\n   definition with no content, put in the pass statement to avoid getting an\n   error.\n\nExample :\n class Person:\n pass\n # having an empty class definition like this, would raise an error without the pass statement\n\n\nComplete Example\nclass Car:  \n\n          # Class Variable  \n          fav_car = 'Verna'             \n\n          #
